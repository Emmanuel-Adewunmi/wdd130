        <p>Lagos is a state in South West, Nigeria. Of the 36 Nigerian states, Lagos is the most populous state but the smallest in terms of land mass. Bounded to the south by the Bight of Benin and to the west by the international border with Benin for 10 km, Lagos State borders Ogun State to the north for about 283 km, making it the only Nigerian state to border only one other state. Named for the city of Lagos—the most populous city in Africa—the state was formed from the Western Region and the former Federal Capital Territory on 27 May 1967 </p>
